# AI Toolkit by Ostris

AI Toolkit is an all in one training suite for diffusion models. I try to support all the latest models on consumer grade hardware. Image and video models. It can be run as a GUI or CLI. It is designed to be easy to use but still have every feature imaginable.

## Installation

Requirements:
- python >3.10
- Nvidia GPU with enough ram to do what you need
- python venv
- git


Linux:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ostris/ai-toolkit.git
cd ai-toolkit
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
# install torch first
pip3 install --no-cache-dir torch==2.6.0 torchvision==0.21.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Windows:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ostris/ai-toolkit.git
cd ai-toolkit
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
pip install --no-cache-dir torch==2.6.0 torchvision==0.21.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## FLUX.1 Training

### Requirements
You currently need a GPU with **at least 24GB of VRAM** to train FLUX.1. If you are using it as your GPU to control 
your monitors, you probably need to set the flag `low_vram: true` in the config file under `model:`. This will quantize
the model on CPU and should allow it to train with monitors attached. Users have gotten it to work on Windows with WSL,
but there are some reports of a bug when running on windows natively. 
I have only tested on linux for now. This is still extremely experimental
and a lot of quantizing and tricks had to happen to get it to fit on 24GB at all. 

### FLUX.1-dev

FLUX.1-dev has a non-commercial license. Which means anything you train will inherit the
non-commercial license. It is also a gated model, so you need to accept the license on HF before using it.
Otherwise, this will fail. Here are the required steps to setup a license.

1. Sign into HF and accept the model access here [black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev)
2. Make a file named `.env` in the root on this folder
3. [Get a READ key from huggingface](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens/new?) and add it to the `.env` file like so `HF_TOKEN=your_key_here`

### FLUX.1-schnell

FLUX.1-schnell is Apache 2.0. Anything trained on it can be licensed however you want and it does not require a HF_TOKEN to train.
However, it does require a special adapter to train with it, [ostris/FLUX.1-schnell-training-adapter](https://huggingface.co/ostris/FLUX.1-schnell-training-adapter).
It is also highly experimental. For best overall quality, training on FLUX.1-dev is recommended.

To use it, You just need to add the assistant to the `model` section of your config file like so:

```yaml
      model:
        name_or_path: "black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-schnell"
        assistant_lora_path: "ostris/FLUX.1-schnell-training-adapter"
        is_flux: true
        quantize: true
```

You also need to adjust your sample steps since schnell does not require as many

```yaml
      sample:
        guidance_scale: 1  # schnell does not do guidance
        sample_steps: 4  # 1 - 4 works well
```

### Training
1. Copy the example config file located at `config/examples/train_lora_flux_24gb.yaml` (`config/examples/train_lora_flux_schnell_24gb.yaml` for schnell) to the `config` folder and rename it to `whatever_you_want.yml`
2. Edit the file following the comments in the file
3. Run the file like so `python run.py config/whatever_you_want.yml`

A folder with the name and the training folder from the config file will be created when you start. It will have all 
checkpoints and images in it. You can stop the training at any time using ctrl+c and when you resume, it will pick back up
from the last checkpoint.

IMPORTANT. If you press crtl+c while it is saving, it will likely corrupt that checkpoint. So wait until it is done saving

## Dataset Preparation

Datasets generally need to be a folder containing images and associated text files. Currently, the only supported
formats are jpg, jpeg, and png. Webp currently has issues. The text files should be named the same as the images
but with a `.txt` extension. For example `image2.jpg` and `image2.txt`. The text file should contain only the caption.
You can add the word `[trigger]` in the caption file and if you have `trigger_word` in your config, it will be automatically
replaced. 

Images are never upscaled but they are downscaled and placed in buckets for batching. **You do not need to crop/resize your images**.
The loader will automatically resize them and can handle varying aspect ratios. 


## Training Specific Layers

To train specific layers with LoRA, you can use the `only_if_contains` network kwargs. For instance, if you want to train only the 2 layers
used by The Last Ben, [mentioned in this post](https://x.com/__TheBen/status/1829554120270987740), you can adjust your
network kwargs like so:

```yaml
      network:
        type: "lora"
        linear: 128
        linear_alpha: 128
        network_kwargs:
          only_if_contains:
            - "transformer.single_transformer_blocks.7.proj_out"
            - "transformer.single_transformer_blocks.20.proj_out"
```

The naming conventions of the layers are in diffusers format, so checking the state dict of a model will reveal 
the suffix of the name of the layers you want to train. You can also use this method to only train specific groups of weights.
For instance to only train the `single_transformer` for FLUX.1, you can use the following:

```yaml
      network:
        type: "lora"
        linear: 128
        linear_alpha: 128
        network_kwargs:
          only_if_contains:
            - "transformer.single_transformer_blocks."
```

You can also exclude layers by their names by using `ignore_if_contains` network kwarg. So to exclude all the single transformer blocks,


```yaml
      network:
        type: "lora"
        linear: 128
        linear_alpha: 128
        network_kwargs:
          ignore_if_contains:
            - "transformer.single_transformer_blocks."
```

`ignore_if_contains` takes priority over `only_if_contains`. So if a weight is covered by both,
if will be ignored.

## LoKr Training

To learn more about LoKr, read more about it at [KohakuBlueleaf/LyCORIS](https://github.com/KohakuBlueleaf/LyCORIS/blob/main/docs/Guidelines.md). To train a LoKr model, you can adjust the network type in the config file like so:

```yaml
      network:
        type: "lokr"
        lokr_full_rank: true
        lokr_factor: 8
```

Everything else should work the same including layer targeting.
